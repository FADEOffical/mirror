Reflections made easy!

## What is mirror?

Mirror is a library around java reflections with _a lot_ of useful methods and an extensive
declarative API for working with those. It is dead-easy to get a hang of it; give it a try!

## How do I get started using mirror?

Call the static `fade.mirror.Mirror.mirror` method and provide a class of your choice. If
you have ever worked with java reflections, the rest should be simple auto-completion
assisted fun! :)

### "Ok, but can I get a concrete example, please?"

Of course, if you need help, tutorials or a guide, check out the detailed javadocs, the wiki
or the discord server! Everyone is welcome!
